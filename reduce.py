#bumboo toilet paper made of bamboo
#the fastest growing plant on the planet! And itâ€™s technically a grass, so with responsible farming, after an initial 3-5 year period
#to reach maturity, it can be re-harvested year after year, for as many as 40 -70 years! Compare this to trees that typically take
#25-40 years to mature and once harvested don't always re-grow naturally and a new tree must be planted.
#in China, most of the bamboo is grown by rural smallholders and administrated through co-operatives, thus supporting rural development and giving farmers a sustainable income.
